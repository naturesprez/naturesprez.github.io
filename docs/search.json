My website is under construction as I am learning to code, a skillset that I believe will be increasingly relevant to planners seeking to integrate the sciences of urban planning and (landscape) ecology. This website was created to share my skills and interests. I’m accredited with the Congress for the New Urbanism and I am the Chapter Lead for the Southwest Chapter–check out our YouTube!
